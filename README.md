Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Project Overview This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The goal is to group customers of a retail store based on their age, annual income, and spending score to identify different purchasing patterns and customer types. The project uses the Mall Customers dataset and applies the K-Means algorithm to form meaningful clusters. It includes visualization of clusters in 2D and 3D, evaluation using WCSS and Silhouette Score, and interpretation of customer behavior across segments.

Steps Involved

Data loading and exploration of the Mall Customers dataset
Selection of important features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score)
Application of the K-Means clustering algorithm
Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
Evaluation using WCSS and Silhouette Score
Visualization of clusters in both 2D and 3D views
Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Output
Segmented customers into meaningful clusters
Plotted 2D and 3D visualizations of customer groups
Calculated clustering metrics for evaluation
Learning Outcome Through this task, I learned how to:
Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning
Determine the optimal number of clusters
Visualize and interpret customer segments effectively
